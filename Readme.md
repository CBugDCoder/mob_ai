Mob AI: Minetest Mob Framework
==============================

_This is in a very WIP state, and is not intended for actual use yet._

Mob AI works on the premise of Drivers. A driver is a state in which a mob can be that controls the mobs actions. Once a driver is active it interfaces with the mob ai internal code to send signals of inputs to the mob's script which determines what new driver to switch to for any given input.

This framework enables mob_ai to be extremely flexible and expandable.
